A base project for programming with the Raspberry Pi.
Currently, only two abstractions are available:

  GPOutput - A GPIO pin used as a general purpose output. This could represent anything
             you can connect to a GPIO pin, such as an LED.
             
  Button   - A push button, connected to one of the GPIO pins.
  
Further classes to be added.
